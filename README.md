Got it! Here’s a revised README that emphasizes that it’s an academic project:

```markdown
# Faraz Coin (FRC)

Faraz Coin (FRC) is an academic project that implements a simple ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. This project is designed to enhance understanding of the ERC20 standard and blockchain technology through practical implementation and testing.

## Features

- **Standard ERC20 Functions**: Includes essential functions such as `transfer`, `balanceOf`, and `allowance`.
- **Custom Token Details**: Name: "Faraz Coin", Symbol: "FRC", Decimals: 18.
- **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive unit tests using Foundry to ensure contract functionality.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
- [Alchemy Account](https://www.alchemy.com/) for connecting to the Sepolia testnet.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/faraz-coin.git
   cd faraz-coin
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   forge install
   ```

## Deployment

### Deploying on Sepolia

1. Set up your Alchemy project and get your API key.
2. Configure your `.env` file with the following details:
   ```
   ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key
   SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
   ```

3. Deploy the contract:
   ```bash
   forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url https://eth-sepolia.alchemyapi.io/v2/your_alchemy_api_key --private-key your_wallet_private_key
   ```

### Verify Contract on Etherscan

1. Go to [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/).
2. Find your contract address.
3. Use the Etherscan verification tool to verify your contract source code.
4. Fill in the details such as the contract name and compiler version used (e.g., `0.8.18`).

## Running Tests

Run the tests to ensure everything works correctly:
```bash
forge test
```
